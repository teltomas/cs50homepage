            I'm from Portugal, I've been roaming the Earth since 1986 and I'm interested in all things science and logic.

            I love observing all the surroundings and experiencing the best the world has to offer.
            Be it music or cinema, be it a stroll in my hometown or a big voyage to the mountains or a big city.
            Be it a diner in a good restaurant, or just to chill in the coffee house at the corner.

            Count me in.
