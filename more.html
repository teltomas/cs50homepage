            As you may already know - in case you have read my "About Me" page - I love all things science and logic.

            Therefore it is no surprise that I've always had an interest in following a career that allowed me to fulfill that love.
When I finished college, I ended up following university studies in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, due to life's many disaventures, I was not able to finish the course and ended up in the labor market doing whatever I was able to.
Eventually I was able to get into de car rental business, where I have spent 10 successful years and ended up being in charge of the fleet management of the biggest rental station in the company.

            But now, I have the option to follow something that I truly desire. So, here I am, studying the CS50 course!
